In the line of **Mediterranean recipes** and after the [Italian recipe](/en/recipes/italian "Click here to see that other recipe"),
here is this alternative for those who do not like capers.  
This recipe savors on a sunny terrace, with a green salad and few french fries.

The **Ricotta** is a cheese from Italia that could be replaced by the french one **Brousse** or the **Brocciu** from Corsica.
These cheese er light and responsible for the freshness of the dish.  
The **avocado** varies the tastes of the meat and make this recipe _lighter_.  
Finally, the black olives build the salty basis of the dish by replacing the capers. You can typically use preparations of olives "Ã  la grecque".
